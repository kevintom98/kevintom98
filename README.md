### Hi there!!  

### I am a budding embedded engineer, who is trying to find balance between hardware and firmware.

Full time graduate student at University of Colorado Boulder specializing in Embedded Systems and IoT.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to control different measuring equipments using python and how to use them to write automated testing scripts.  

**Lot of the repositories I work on are private, since they are related to coursework.**
